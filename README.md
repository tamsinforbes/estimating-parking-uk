# Estimating parking provision for the UK an MSc Data Science project 

I completed this work in two stages over two summers (2020 and 2021) during a part time MSc in Data Science with Exeter University. The first project *Parking Provision Project* (PPP) focuses on estimating the off-street parking available in a test area, and specifically considers parking avaiable in residential front gardens. The second project *On-Street Parking* (OSP) focuses on on-street parking availability in the same test area.

This repository is intended as a record of the codebase for my personal archive. I have made it public as there is some interest in this work. The repository does not contain any of the data used, hence none of the code will run. The `ipynb` outputs from the last run with data are included. I have not provided a reproducible environment or package manager. I make no apology for the state of the code.

# Directories

- python: contains all the code, *ppp* prefix relates to the 2020 project and *osp* to the 2021 continuation.

- reports: reports, presentations and recordings named chronologically.
